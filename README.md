# Diabetes Prediction Using Machine Learning

Experimenting Machine Learning Techniques with simple neural networks to predict diabetes using PIMA Database.

## PIMA Database

The PIMA Indians Diabetes Database is a set of data that stores data of indian women (such as glicose levels, times pregnant, blood pressure etc.) and indicates wheter those women are diagnosed with diabetes or not. It is largerly used for biomedical research groups to understand diabetes factors and how to predict it.

## Machine Learning with PIMA

The use of simple neural network architectures on PIMA data to predict the presence or not of diabetes can easily reach up to ~80% hit rate and that's the focused of the Part I of this Jupyter Notebook.

During Part II of this experiment, however, it was shown that not all data are completely relevant to determine the presence of diabetes and it was demonstrated that using just a fraction of it showed similar hit rates results.

## Trying to Reduce the Required Medical Inputs

For the purpose of this experiment, it was interesting if we could determine the presence of diabetes using exclusively information that the pacient could provide, without the need to make any medical procedure (taking blood samples for example). Part III showed the unsuccessfull attempts of the prediction of Glicose levels using a Stroke Prediction database. The efforts were not high on this and perhaps advanced machine learning techniques could show a more tempting result.
